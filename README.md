My name is Barri3, I am a hobbist programmer that has been writing
code since 2009 and messing with the Bohemia Interactive Arma game series since early 2014.

I have worked on many missions including A2 Domination, A2 Patrol Operations, A3 Patrol Operations,
A3 Insurgency.

My main project is the revival of A2 Patrol Operations, this is requiring a near full rewrite to get on
the Arma 3 engine. Once stable, the plans of expanding are huge!

Aside from the my Arma 3 hobby (Addiction!), I am the Director of GameBrewers UK Limited. I hope in the coming
months I can release the first game of the company called CST.
